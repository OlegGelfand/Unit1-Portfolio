        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>	
          My upbringing is completely definitive of who I am today. That may sound obvious, however it is not. Although I am grateful to both my parents for bringing me into this world, it was my Mom who truly raised me. Now, normally in this kind of home, one would think that the kids would simply mimic their parents and recreate the home innately if they merit their own. I did not do this, I was able to learn from people around me, watch as they demonstrated healthy philosophies, and incorporate them. I therefore began yearning for a Wife of my own, kids of my own, and I was determined to be the best husband, father, leader that I could be to my kids. I believe whatever you call that, is the definition of me.
          I went to college thinking I would get a generic degree, juggle 1 or 2 jobs, and wind up with a good job as long as I didn’t quit. I chose my generic degree to be one in financial planning. Reason being, I really wanted to help people feel good, get the anxiety out of them, and let them breath. I had already ruled out the medical field seeing as I don’t want the responsibility of dealing with life and death decisions and cannot fathom performing a shot, or operation of any kind. 
          I had a really enjoyable time working for Panera, I started at 16 and was well on my way to being fired. I then had a mind-shift and really felt a need to be somebody and develop myself. I pushed to be cross-trained until there was not one area of the store that I had mastered. This led to me being a key-employee, I developed a reputation of never stopping, whether we were busy or not. If we were not busy, I would clean, check on customers, find something to do. I really felt proud of doing what I was doing, felt like I had snuck a way into peoples’ lives to add a happy feel.  
          My following job, my first, “real,” job was a Client Account Rep for Safeguard properties. I had a badge! I spent 6 months working and was promoted to trainer of that position. A year later I was promoted to Service Quality Analyst and spent the remaining tenure until massive downsizing hit Safeguard, 5 years later.  These positions were fun, I learned excel well, enjoyed my team, helped improve processes and saved the company over $300,000. I was there without movement for too long however and prior to layoff began searching for a new career. 
          This is when I got excited about programming. I was speaking to a few friends of mine, programmers, and realized how closely my hobbies resembled programming, and that this lucrative career could combine my hobbies, love of family, and love of helping together. My future became bright. Finally a position, I don’t just enjoy but love, that could also provide for my family.
          In my spare time, I build, I have lots of tools and love playing around in the garage, or fixing things in the home. “What could I do better today?”. I’ve already gotten my 5yr old (I have a 5,3, and 1 yr old) involved. My most proud build so far is my workbench that spans 6’ x 4’ and houses my tablesaw, router, on the surface, with many other tools below. I hope it is clear now, my love of building, and I can’t wait to show you, my love of programming!
